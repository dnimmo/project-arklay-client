# Project Arklay v2

Project Arklay is a simple text adventure game that you can play by visiting http://project-arklay.com. This has been very much a spare time project, and work sporadically continues. If you have any thoughts, or find any issues, please feel free to get in touch: dnimmo@gmail.com

# Installation requirements:
+ Elm v0.18
+ Node v4+

# Setup
Run `npm i && npm run start`. You'll have to install the `Elm` dependencies, but you'll be asked if you want to or not. You're not Zammo, so just say yes.
